Welcome to my personal portfolio.

I am a full stack web developer with a focus on the back end. I work primarily with javascript and node but I am starting to learn python/django. I use Express for my servers, MongoDB or MySQL as a database, and Handlebars as a template. I'm also familiar with frontend development using HTML, CSS, javascript, jQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap.
